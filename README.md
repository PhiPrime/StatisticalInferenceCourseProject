# StatisticalInferenceCourseProject
This project is to demonstate my understanding of statistical inference by demonstrating CLT on a sample of an exponetial distribution, and a brief analysis of the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

This project is within two directories, `CLT_Simulation_(Part_1)` and `ToothGrowth_Analysis_(Part_2)` each of which have `Report` and `Appendix` directories within them for the relevant documents of each part.
